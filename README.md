## Overview

Welcome to the `spatial_HPC` project! In this study, we generated
spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus
RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from adjacent tissue sections of the
anterior human hippocampus across ten adult neurotypical donors. SRT
data was generated using [10x Genomics
**Visium**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression)
(n=36 capture areas) and [10x Genomics **Visium Spatial Proteogenomics**
(SPG)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-proteogenomics) (n=8
capture areas). snRNA-seq data was generated using [10x Genomics
**Chromium**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-gene-expression)
(n=26 total snRNA-seq libraries).

## Study design

<img src="https://research.libd.org/spatial_hpc/img/Copy%20of%20HPC%20figure%201.png" width="1000px" align="left" />

Experimental design to generate paired single-nucleus RNA-sequencing
(snRNA-seq) and spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data in the
human hippocampus. (A) Postmortem human tissue blocks from the anterior
hippocampus were dissected from 10 adult neurotypical brain donors.
Tissue blocks were scored and cryosectioned for snRNA-seq assays (red),
and placement on Visium slides (Visium H&E, black; Visium Spatial
Proteogenomics (SPG), yellow). (B) 10Œºm tissue sections from all ten
donors were placed onto 2-5 capture areas to include the extent of the
HPC(n=36 total capture areas), for measurement with the 10x Genomics
Visium H&E platform. (C) 10Œºm tissue sections from two donors were
placed onto 4 capture areas (n=8 total capture areas) for measurement
with the 10x Genomics Visium-SPG platform. (D) Tissue sections (2-4
100Œºm cryosections per assay) from all ten donors were collected from
the same tissue blocks for measurement with the 10x Genomics 3‚Äô gene
expression platform. For each donor, we sorted on both and PI+NeuN+
(n=26 total snRNA-seq libraries). (This figure was created with
